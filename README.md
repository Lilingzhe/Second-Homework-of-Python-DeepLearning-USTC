# Second-Homework-of-Python-DeepLearning-USTC
This project is based on the exmaple of pytorch, imagenet. 
Its output dimension turn to 200 by change the last FC layer. 
We define two functions to change the structure of tiny-imagenet validation to obtain a correct accuracy.
Save log adn using tensorboard to show accuracy and loss curve on train-set and validation-set.
